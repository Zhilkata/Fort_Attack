What's the project about:
Fort Attack - Fantasy Siege "Sim"

Prototype level stuff, idea sketching.
General ideas:

- Lords with unique armies, dictating the sieges.
- Random events for resources(food, water, supplies, information, etc.).
- Battle sim with random chances for successes and failures for individual heroes(Nemesis system incorporated here?)
- Losing is fun, I guess.
